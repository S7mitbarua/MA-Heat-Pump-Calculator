# Massachusetts Heat Pump Calculator
The Massachusetts Heat Pump Calculator is a simple tool designed to estimate the usage of a heat pump for heating purposes in different cities within the state of Massachusetts. The calculator considers the current outdoor temperature, heating system efficiency, and the target indoor temperature to calculate the amount of heat needed to achieve the desired indoor temperature.

# How to use
1. Installation: There is no need to install anything. This calculator is designed to run on Google Colab, an online Python environment.
2. Run the Calculator: Open the provided Google Colab notebook, and run the cells containing the code for the calculator.
3. City Selection: When prompted, enter the name of the city in Massachusetts for which you want to calculate the heat pump usage. The calculator will fetch the current outdoor temperature for the selected city. (Note: For simplicity, dummy weather data is used in this example. In practice, you can use real weather APIs or web scraping to get the actual weather data.)
4. Heating System Efficiency: Enter the efficiency of the heating system as a decimal value. This value represents the fraction of energy effectively used for heating.
5. Target Indoor Temperature: Enter the desired indoor temperature in degrees Fahrenheit.
6. Result: The calculator will then provide the estimated amount of heat (in BTUs) needed to reach the target indoor temperature.

# Limitations
1. This calculator is a simple example and does not take into account various factors like insulation, heat loss, or the actual capacity of the heat pump.
2. The current version of the calculator uses dummy weather data for demonstration purposes. For accurate results, you should integrate real weather data using appropriate APIs or web scraping techniques.
3. The heating system efficiency is assumed to be constant. In practice, the efficiency of the heating system may vary based on the type of system and its condition.

# Future Improvements
To make the Massachusetts Heat Pump Calculator more robust and accurate, consider the following improvements:
1. Implement a real-time weather data API or web scraping to fetch accurate outdoor temperature information for each city in Massachusetts.
2. Enhance the calculator to consider various types of heating systems and their respective efficiencies.
3. Incorporate additional factors like insulation quality, heat loss, and heat pump capacity to provide more precise estimates.
4. Create a graphical user interface (GUI) to make it user-friendly and accessible to a broader audience.
